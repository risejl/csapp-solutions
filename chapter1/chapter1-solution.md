# Problem 1 

## Problem 1.1 Solution: 

we can drive at 150km/h at the length of 1500km, which will spend 10hours, and for the rest of 1000km, we can only drive for 100km/h, which will cost 10hours. 

so the total cost will be: 10 + 10 = 20hours.

That will give us a speedup of 25 / 20 = 1.25x

## Problem 1.2 Solution: 

if we drive at 100km/h as early, we can assume that the T<sub>new</sub> will be **x** hours, based on 1.67x speedup, T<sub>new</sub> = 25 / 1.67 = 14.97hours.

and we can only drive at 100km/h at the length of 1000km, so this 10hours will remain the same, so the speed S<sub>new</sub> = 1500 / (14.97-10) = 300km/h.



# Problem 2 Solution:

we can assume that the origin time we used for 80% part the system is **a** hours, so the P<sub>old</sub> = 0.8a + 0.2a. we can also assume that we improves k for that part, which only use a/k hours, so the P<sub>new</sub> = 0.8a/k + 0.2a, and P<sub>new</sub> / P<sub>old</sub> = 2, so k = 2.67.
